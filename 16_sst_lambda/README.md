# README

Demonstrate how to use SST to host a lambda function.  

TODO:

* Parameterise regions and layer:versions locations better
* SSM parameters
* Add zod
* Real file system in lambda.
* The layers don't look right
* Difference between start and deploy.
* Single step debugging is not working.

## Reason

Using serverless stack over serverless as it is better maintained  

NOTES:

* Ensure you call endpoints with `-H 'Content-Type: application/json'` otherwise body will be base64 encoded.  
* When running wih start `/opt` seems mapped to local filesystem.  
* When you delete a layer version, you can no longer configure a Lambda function to use it. However, any function that already uses the version continues to have access to it. Version numbers are never reused for a layer name.

## Demonstrates

* Multiple functions registered
* Adding tags to the functions.  
* Triggering from a self posted message to a queue
* Using middy as middleware
* Adding layers from built binaries.
* Long running functions, past API gateway timeout.  
* Permissions to read from bucket
* POSTing a binary to an API.  

NOTES:

* It looks like you have to have middleware attached for a middy request to work.  
* If the stack gets caught up it can be removed in CloudFormation  

## Prepare

```sh
npx create-sst@latest 16_sst_lambda

nvm use
npm install
```

## Start

```sh
export SST_STAGE=dev
set -a
. ./.env.${SST_STAGE}.local
set +a
```

## Layers

```sh
./build.sh --buildlayers --publishlayers
```

## Deploy Lambda

```sh
npm run start -- --stage ${SST_STAGE}
```

```sh
npm run deploy -- --stage ${SST_STAGE}
```

## Testing

```sh
export STACK_URL=https://qomx89h8nl.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
# queue a message
curl -X GET $STACK_URL 

# look at filesystem
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "folder": "/opt", "recursive": true }' $STACK_URL/fs

# bucket listing
export PREFIX=single-file/

curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "action":"list", "bucket": "mybucket", "bucketRegion": "us-east-1", "prefix": "/" }' $STACK_URL/bucket

curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "action":"listObjects", "bucket": "mybucket", "bucketRegion": "us-east-1", "prefix": "'${PREFIX}'" }' $STACK_URL/bucket

curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "action":"copyObjects", "bucket": "mybucket", "bucketRegion": "us-east-1", "prefix": "'${PREFIX}'" }' $STACK_URL/bucket

curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "folder": "/tmp", "recursive": true }' $STACK_URL/fs

# run sox or ffmpeg
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}' $STACK_URL/sox 
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}' $STACK_URL/ffmpeg
```
